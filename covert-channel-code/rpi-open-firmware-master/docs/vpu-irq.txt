MMIOBASE + 0x2000 == IC0
MMIOBASE + 0x2800 == IC1

ICn + 0x10 is the irq masking registers
each register is 32bits wide, and references 8 irq
ICn+0x10 is for irq 0-7
ICn+0x14 is for irq 8-15
ICn+0x18 is for irq 9-23
ICn+0x1c is for irq 24-31
ICn+0x20 is for irq 32-39
ICn+0x24 is for irq 40-47
ICn+0x28 is for irq 48-55
ICn+0x2c is for irq 56-63

for each register, it contains an array of 8 x 4bit fields
setting all 4 bits to 0xF will enable an irq

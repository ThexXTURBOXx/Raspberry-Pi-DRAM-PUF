> Pi0-3 use T-format for textures into V3D.
> Pi4 uses UIF format, but has a hardware block (the Texture Formatter Unit or TFU) to convert other formats into UIF efficiently. That said it's just been noted that NV12/21 haven't been using the hardware - that's being fixed.

> Pi4 will take YUV in through the TFU (Texture Formatter Unit) to create a texture. I think Pi3 has a shader which will do the same thing.
> Yes the TFU is hardware. The Pi4 3D block needs all textures in UIF format, so even RGB source images go through it.


v3d can render to both linear and tiled (t-format or uif) formats
